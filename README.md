This data mining project helps identify cybersecurity threats from user descriptions. Built for my data mining course, it tackles real-world challenges like messy data and pattern detection.
A practical demo of data mining concepts - so I created an AI chatbot that analyzes threat reports while handling noisy real-world data.

How it works:

You describe a potential threat (e.g., "weird emails asking for passwords")

The system:

Cleans and standardizes the text

Matches against 200+ threat patterns in the dataset(30 clean + 170 noisy samples)

Flags anomalies and inconsistencies

Returns the threat type, severity, and prevention tips

Tech highlights:

Processes messy data (misspellings, slang, incomplete info)

Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity for accurate matching

Demonstrates full data mining pipeline from raw data to insight
